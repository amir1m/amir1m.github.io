This paper is about improving the classification capabilities  of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Here we experimented with various architectures of DNNs, from smaller/shallow neural networks to more complex networks. To avoid overfitting we  made use techniques such as dropout and regularization. For tuning Hyper-parameters we used techniques such as random search, grid search, Hyperband & Bayesian Optimization. Use of these techniques gradually reduces the time required to tune the DNN as well as bounding the validation error.
